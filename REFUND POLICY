Pocket Market – Refund & Return Policy

Last Updated: [25/11/2025]

Pocket Market is a marketplace connecting buyers and independent sellers. This Refund Policy explains how refunds, returns, and disputes are handled.

1. Who Is Responsible for Refunds?

Because Pocket Market is not the seller of products, each seller is responsible for honouring refunds, returns, and guarantees.
Pocket Market assists by providing dispute resolution, but sellers make the final decision based on their policies — unless a violation is confirmed.

2. Eligible Refund Reasons

Buyers may request a refund if:

The item never arrived

The seller delivered a wrong item

The product was damaged on arrival

The item was fake or misrepresented

The seller failed to respond

3. Non-Eligible Refund Reasons

Refunds may not apply to:

Change of mind

Items that match the description

Perishable goods

Digital goods already downloaded

Items explicitly marked “no refund” (unless fraudulent)

4. Refund Process

Buyer opens a dispute within 3–7 days of delivery.

Seller must respond within 48 hours.

Pocket Market may intervene if:

A seller refuses to respond

Fraud or violation is suspected

If approved, refunds are processed to:

Buyer’s bank account, or

Buyer’s Pocket Market wallet (if enabled)

5. Delivery Issues

If an item does not arrive:

Seller must provide proof of delivery.

If no proof, buyer receives a full refund.

6. Seller Penalties
